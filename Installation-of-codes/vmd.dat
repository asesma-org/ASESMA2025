Simplified instructions:

1) Visit https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD
and choose the VDM Version 1.9.3 that matches the computers' specifications (LINUX_64 OpenGL, CUDA, OptiX, OSPRay).

2) Download the tar.gz (A Registration is needed)

3) Un compress the folder vmd-1.9.3 from the  tar.gz file.

4) Enter to the vmd-1.9.3  folder and run:  ./configure

5) Enter to the src folder and run:  sudo make install

6) Test the installation running: vmd

Detailed instructions for compiling VMD from source code
can be found in the programmer's guide.

For quick installation of the binary distribution for Unix do the following:
  1) Uncompress and untar the distribution into a working directory,
     being sure to do this and subsequent steps as a non-root user.
     In this working directory, there are several subdirectories such
     as bin, src, doc, data, as well as this README and a configure script.
     Change to this working directory after the unpacking is complete.

  2) Edit the file 'configure'; change the values for
     the $install_library_dir and $install_bin_dir to a directory in
     which vmd data files and executables should be installed, be sure
     that you installing into a clean target directory and not overwriting
     an existing version of VMD (which would otherwise give problems):

     $install_bin_dir is the location of the startup script 'vmd'.
     It should be located in the path of users interested in running VMD.

     $install_library_dir is the location of all other VMD files.
     This included the binary and helper scripts.  It should not be
     in the path.

  3) A Makefile must be generated based on these configuration variables
     by running "./configure".

  4) After configuration is complete, cd to the src directory,
     become root or use sudo if necessary, e.g., for installation
     of VMD into /usr/local or other permission-protected system directories,
     and type "make install".  This will install VMD in the two
     directories listed above.  Note that running "make install"
     twice will print error messages because you are attempting to
     overwrite some read-only files.  Similarly, if you have incorrectly
     specified the target installation directories or attempt to overwrite
     an existing VMD installation, you will get error messages.

  5) When installed, type 'vmd' to start (make sure the
     $install_bin_dir directory is in your path).
