# PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE:
## convergence test for cutoff energy (ecutwfc) via traditional Unix shell-script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Steps to perform:**

1. Read the `scan_ecut.sh` script and try to understand it.

2. To run the example, execute:

       bash ./scan_ecut.sh
       
3. To gather the energies, execute:

       bash ./gather_data.sh
       
4. To plot the data, run:
	
       python3 ./plot_etot_ecut.py
