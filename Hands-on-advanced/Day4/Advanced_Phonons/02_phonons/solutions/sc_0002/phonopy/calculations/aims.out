  #  Suggested "light" defaults for Si atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #  Be sure to double-check any results obtained with these settings for post-processing,
  #  e.g., with the "tight" defaults and larger basis sets.
  #
  #  2020/09/08 Added f function to "light" after reinspection of Delta test outcomes.
  #             This was done for all of Al-Cl and is a tricky decision since it makes
  #             "light" calculations measurably more expensive for these elements.
  #             Nevertheless, outcomes for P, S, Cl (and to some extent, Si) appear
  #             to justify this choice.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -15748.267656709 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -15748.267656709 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       12.920 MB (on task 1 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Maximum:       14.439 MB (on task 6 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Average:       13.576 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        3.214 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 1)
          |   Maximum:        3.922 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 6)
          |   Average:        3.519 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
