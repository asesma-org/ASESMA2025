  #  Suggested "light_spd" defaults for Si atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  These settings are the former "light" settings for main group elements Al-Cl and Ga-Br.
  #  In the current "light" settings, an f function was added to the default "light" basis sets,
  #  which improves the description of bulk solid properties in the "Delta test".
  #  The "light_spd" defaults do not contain this "f" function to provide backward compatibility.
  #  Also, for many purposes (such as quick screening) the present "light_spd" settings, going
  #  up only to d functions, may still be helpful.
  #
  #  Be sure to double-check any results obtained with these settings for post-processing,
  #  e.g., with the "tight" defaults and larger basis sets.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.77747666 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.13718722 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:      30 at    0.000000    0.625000    0.625000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.64028944 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 30
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      2.39820128 eV for k_point 5 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -5.22374111 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -15748.176195227 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -15748.176195227 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -12.160054204 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
