# ASESMA school 2025 (Accra, Ghana)

Website of the event: https://indico.ictp.it/event/10846/overview

This is a tutorial for calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT) using the open-source [Quantum ESPRESSO distribution](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) [1], Yambo [2], Siesta [3], deMon2k [4], TBPW, and others. 

In each subfolder you will find a file README.md with the basic instructions on how to run the exercises. A more detailed description of the content of the exercises is given in the PDF file containing the slides that the lecturers will present during the hands-on sessions. All the pseudopotential files needed to run the exercises can be found in the ```files``` folder.
