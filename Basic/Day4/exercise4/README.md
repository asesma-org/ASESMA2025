exercise-4.a: Perform convergence tests of the band gap of Si using the SCAN functional 
              with the SCAN-generated pseudopotential (Si.SCAN.UPF).
              Consider the kinetic-energy curoff ecutwfc from 20 to 200 Ry (with a 10 Ry step).
              What is the converged band gap value? 
              What is the optimal cutoff (with the accuracy of the band gap of ~0.001 eV)?

exercise-4.b: Calculate the band gap of Si using the SCAN functional with the PBE-generated
              pseudopotentials (Si.pbe_PseudoDojo.UPF and Si_ONCV_PBE-1.2.upf) and using the 
              optimized cutoff from the previous exercise. Compare these band gap values
              with the one obtained in the previous exercise.

exercise-4.c: Calculate the band gap of Si using the rSCAN and r2SCAN functionals with the
              PBE-generated pseudopotential Si_ONCV_PBE-1.2.upf. Compare the computed band
              gap value with the one obtaned from SCAN and experiments. Which meta-GGA
              functional gives the closest agreement with experiments for the band gap of Si?
